1. Pinout GPIO to the PCB

2. Fix memory(EPROM) footprint

3. align the edge pins so that it fits in a nice circle

4. POT's SPI interface needs better renaming. Currently it is qutie confusing 

5. use 100K pot for the LED driver

6. reverse the sink/source polarity for LED

7. Edit the foot print of the mechanical connectors to make sure they align well.

8. DC path needs to be changes to support current limits of LED driver

9. LTM needs to produce 5.5V rails and 3.3V raile for LED driver and digital stuff, repectively. 3.3 is dropped to 1.2 via LDO.

10. Potentially replace the SMA with Hirose MMCX
