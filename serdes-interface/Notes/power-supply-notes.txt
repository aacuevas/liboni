Max current draw of each intan chip is 16 mA. There are a max of 4 chips. So with a 2X safety factor to deal with other components:

2 * (4 * 16) =~ 130 mA

If we are dropping from a 12V supply, the dropout voltage will be

12V - 3.5V = 8.5V

So, thermal power dissipation is

P_therm = 8.5V * 0.13A = 1.1 W.
