The Omnetics SPI Wire adapter provides and easy to solder pin out for the
omnetics PZN-12-AA header. This design is a slightly modified version of the
one provided by [Intan](http://www.intantech.com/downloads.html#PCB).

Changes include:

- 50% reduction in pcb footprint for cheaper printing and less bulk when put in
  line with a cable.
- Design rules make OSH Park compatible.
